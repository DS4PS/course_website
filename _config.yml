    title: Intro to Data Science for the Social Sector
    image: imac.svg
    subtitle: This course introduces students to the field of data science and its applications in the public and nonprofit sectors. Modern performance management and evaluation processes require strong data literacy and the ability to combine and analyze data from a variety of sources to inform managerial processes. We offer a practical, tools-based approach that is designed to build strong foundations for people that want to work as analysts, data-driven managers, or data-driven journalists. We will cover data programming fundamentals, visualization, text analysis, automated reporting, and dynamic reporting using dashboards. The course is analytically rigorous, but no prior programming experience is assumed.
