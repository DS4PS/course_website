# On Being Nonprofit   
["slides"]{@lecture 03-deck.html}

* By the end of this unit, you will:
  + Develop critical observations about the founding of new public charities
  + Recognize and prioritize the range of ways that people reference the nonprofit sector

I'm also interested in your development of basic professional skills, such as using Excel to work with and draw conclusions from data.  At the end of this Unit, you need to be familiar with the framework by which Peter Frumkin organizes the sector and the layout of his book, which also structures the layout of this class.

## Assigned Readings  

* Frumkin, On Being Nonprofit, Chapter 1
* Arizona Nonprofit Incorporation:
  + [Instructions:](http://www.azcc.gov/Divisions/Corporations/forms/starpas/instructionsSTPS/C011i-Instructions-Articles-of-Inc-Nonprofit-STPS.pdf)

  + Form:  http://www. azcc.gov/Divisions/Corporations/forms/starpas/formsSTPS/C011-Articles-of-Incorporation-Nonprofit.pdf


## Exercises  

* Data Exercise

Part 1: Get the IRS file for nonprofits in your state
Follow this URL:  https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/exempt-organizations-business-master-file-extract-eo-bmf
Download the Exempt Organization Business Master File Extract Excel file for your state:
1. Click on your state.  You should be given the option to save a copy of the Excel file, or your browser will automatically download it. 
2. Save the file. (Note above the U.S. map that the IRS tells you the DATE at which it last uploaded data.  As I write this I'm seeing 06/13/2016, but you may very well be seeing a more current date.  Whenever I save this file, I put that DATE in the filename, so I always know what exactly my datafile represents.)
