# Resources

Here are some resources to get you started with the course and to help with projects, as well as offer background on cool data science projects in the social sector.

Just like learning a new language, there is no way to become fluent in a semester or a year. You can, however, become conversant enough to start traveling extensively in this new world of data science. Much of it has been built in virtual settings, and you will be amazed at how many free resources are available when you know how and where to look.

## The Data Science Ecosystem

Pete Warden created one of the first [data science toolkits](http://www.datasciencetoolkit.org/), which is a collection of open-source tools for common tasks in data science like turning street addresses into geo-coordinates, extracting sentiments from text, and identifying people's names in documents. The original toolkit started out as a simple website with a couple of dozen of these tools.

The R community has taken this to another scale. There are currently 13,000 free and open-source packages available in R. It is better to think about R as an operating system, and the contributed packages as the programs you use for specific tasks. 

In addition to packages created for R, there are also powerful tools that make it easier to share data, collaborate on work, and share your results in creative ways. One of the reasons R has become an industry favorite is that it is highly integrated into this ecosystem. Many of these tools are built-right into R Studio, making it easier to manage large projects or collaborate.

A big part of this course is learning about some of these resources and how they fit together to improve work-flow, analysis, and reporting. The most powerful tool that you will discover, however, is the community of smart and creative people active in the field of data science. Some are engineers working on solutions to hard technical problems in the open source space, but most are regular users such as data analysts, artists, educators and activists. Once you understand a few foundational concepts and develop a rudimentary vocabulary you can tap into the community through message boards and list-serves.

## Installing R

R is a programming langauge that was [designed specifically for data analysis](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/07/technology/business-computing/07program.html). Along with Python, it is the [most popular tool](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/10/10/impressive-growth-r/) used by data scientists, data journalists, and quantitative social scientists.

## Collaboration Tools

Working in groups [is hard](https://www.ted.com/talks/clay_shirky_on_institutions_versus_collaboration). Most work is done in groups. As a result, project management is a non-trivial task that should not be approached in an ad-hoc fashion. The field of data science has inherited many great collaboration tools that were developed to manage large teams of software engineers, but are being used for many other creative purposes:

Install GitHub in R Studio

This course will introduce students to [GitHub](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2018/06/18/what-is-github), one of the most popular collaboration and publishing platforms used by the open source community. GitHub is integrated into R Studio for easy deployment.
