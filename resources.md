# Resources

Here are some resources to get you started with the course and to help with projects, as well as offer background on cool data science projects in the social sector.

Just like learning a new language, there is no way to become fluent in a semester or a year. You can, however, become conversant enough to start traveling extensively in this new world of data science. Much of it has been built in virtual settings, and you will be amazed at how many free resources are available when you know how and where to look.

## The Data Science Ecosystem

Pete Warden created one of the first [data science toolkits](http://www.datasciencetoolkit.org/), which is a collection of open-source tools for common tasks in data science like turning street addresses into geo-coordinates, extracting sentiments from text, and identifying people's names in documents. The original toolkit started out as a simple website with a couple of dozen of these tools.

The R community has taken this to another scale. There are currently 13,000 free and open-source packages available in R. It is better to think about R as an operating system, and the contributed packages as the programs you use for specific tasks. 

In addition to packages created for R, there are also powerful tools that make it easier to share data, collaborate on work, and share your results in creative ways. One of the reasons R has become an industry favorite is that it is highly integrated into this ecosystem. Many of these tools are built-right into R Studio, making it easier to manage large projects or collaborate.

The most powerful tool that you can learn to utilize is the community of smart and creative people active in the field of data science. A big part of this class is learning about some of these resources and how they fit together to improve work-flow, analysis, and reporting. Another part if gaining some familiarity with communities of data artists, educators, intellectuals, and activists that comprise the open source community.

## Installing R

R is a programming langauge that was [designed specifically for data analysis](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/07/technology/business-computing/07program.html). Along with Python, it is the [most popular tool](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/10/10/impressive-growth-r/) used by data scientists, data journalists, and quantitative social scientists.
