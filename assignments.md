Labs are worth 60% of your grade. They are graded pass-fail. You get to drop one lab.

# Discussion Boards
  

Discussion boards are worth 20% of the final grade. We will be using Yellowdig, accessible on our course [Canvas page](http://www.canvas.asu.edu).

Yellowdig is a Facebook-style discussion board that is organized different than traditional boards that are centered around threads on topics. Instead it has a feed where students create "pins" based upon the topic that week. You receive points for posting pins, for the resonses that you get to your ideas, for interacting on other students' pins, and when you receive accolades from students or the professor. In this way, it measures engagement rather than word counts used on traditional discussion board (if you post a bunch of long and boring blogs no one will respond to your pins).

The labs in the course focus on the technical skills of data science, so these discussions are meant to balance the class with an opportunity to explore some interesting topics and trends in technology and society. They are open-ended as a means to invite curiosity and critical thinkings.

### Aug 24-Sept 7: The Promise of Big, Open Data

The world is simultaneously generating more data than it has ever before, as well as pushing for policies for making government data more accessible and democratic. These trends and movements is an important enabling aspect of data science, becuse it provides opportunity for real insights that can change our understanding of systems and allow us to hold institutions accountable.

So ignoring potential problems with big and open data for now, read about two interesting cases where big and open data have offered deep insights into city planning and human nature. 

"[A Data Analyst's Blog Is Transforming How New Yorkers See Their City](https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2014/11/28/367046864/a-data-analysts-blog-is-transforming-how-new-yorkers-see-their-city
)", NPR, Nov 2018.

[How a blog saved OK Cupid](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/christian-rudder-dataclysm-okcupid/), FiveThirtyEight Blog, Nov 2014.


<br> 

**ASSIGNMENT: For your discussion topic this week, find one data-driven blog post from Ben Wellington's [I Quant NY](http://iquantny.tumblr.com/) and/or OK Cupid's [OK Trends](https://theblog.okcupid.com/tagged/data) where you discovered something cool that you did not know, and share it with the group. In your post highlight what is interesting about the example, and what data made it possible.**

<br>

You can also check out Ben's [Ted Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xsvGYIxJok), or this short interview.

### Aug 31-Sept 7: The Perils of Open Data

Big and open data can generate powerful insights, but with great power comes great responsibility. In some cases, it might create transparency and improve policy. In others it can be used to manipulate populations and distort accountability. 

"[The Data that Turned the World Upside Down: How Cambridge Analytica used your Facebook data to help the Donald Trump campaign in the 2016 election.](https://publicpolicy.stanford.edu/news/data-turned-world-upside-down)", 

This example poses many interesting dilemas. The Obama campaign was celebrated for using data to enhance voter mobilization. One can argue that the Trump campaign simply embraced the same strategy. Are we being unfair to laude one candidate for his data acumen but criticize another for similar tactics? What are the important differences between the two cases? 

**ASSIGNMENT: For your disccusion this week, post a pin with some thoughts about the potential downside of big & open data, ethics in a time of big data, and what sorts of privacy rules you would devise to balance the benefits that can come from access to data along with challenges of data governance.**

### Sep 7-Sept 14: The Best of R

You might not have heard, but [nerd is the new black](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323478304578332850293360468). And there is [nothing hotter than learning R](http://www.startfactor.pt/uploads/3/8/5/0/38505347/r-is-still-hot.pdf).

But what is R, and what are the nerds using it for? 

**This week, your task is to explore a few blogs about tools in R and find one package or application that you are excited about. It can be an analytics package, a graphics package, a specific application, or otherwise.**

Mine, personally, was the package that allows you to create comic strip graphics in R:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12675147/how-can-we-make-xkcd-style-graphs

We warned up-front, this assignment might be overwhelming in you are wading into a new community where the technical language is unfamiliar and the volume of information vast. There are currently over 13,000 packages available in R! That is partly the point of the assignment - recognizing the sheer volume of creativity surrounding the R community. But also learning how to find some sources that make the content accessible. Here are a few to get you started:

https://awesome-r.com/

https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/

https://blog.feedspot.com/r_programming_blogs/

https://www.r-bloggers.com/

### Developing Expertise

One easy way to develop expertise in this realm is to start a [Feedly account](https://feedly.com) in order to follow thought leaders in the field.

![](/assets/img/feedly.png)

Alternatively you can find folks on Twitter or Facebook. 

Either way, add some data science to your news feeds to increase your exposure and expertise.
