Labs are worth 60% of your grade. They are graded pass-fail. You get to drop one lab.

You will submit labs via Canvas at <http://canvas.asu.edu>.

<br><br>





# Discussion Boards
  

Discussion boards are worth 20% of the final grade. We will be using Yellowdig, accessible on our course Canvas site:

**[CANVAS PORTAL](http://www.canvas.asu.edu)**

Yellowdig is a Facebook-style discussion board that is organized different than traditional boards that are centered around threads on topics. Instead it has a feed where students create "pins" based upon the topic that week. You receive points for posting pins, for the resonses that you get to your ideas, for interacting on other students' pins, and when you receive accolades from students or the professor. In this way, it measures engagement rather than word counts used on traditional discussion board (if you post a bunch of long and boring blogs no one will respond to your pins).

The labs in the course focus on the technical skills of data science, so these discussions are meant to balance the class with an opportunity to explore some interesting topics and trends in technology and society. They are open-ended as a means to invite curiosity and critical thinkings.

### Aug 24-Sept 7: The Promise of Big, Open Data

The world is simultaneously generating more data than it has ever before, as well as pushing for policies for making government data more accessible and democratic. These trends and movements is an important enabling aspect of data science, becuse it provides opportunity for real insights that can change our understanding of systems and allow us to hold institutions accountable.

So ignoring potential problems with big and open data for now, read about two interesting cases where big and open data have offered deep insights into city planning and human nature. 

"[A Data Analyst's Blog](https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2014/11/28/367046864/a-data-analysts-blog-is-transforming-how-new-yorkers-see-their-city
) Is Transforming How New Yorkers See Their City", NPR, Nov 2018.

[How a blog saved OK Cupid](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/christian-rudder-dataclysm-okcupid/), FiveThirtyEight Blog, Nov 2014.


<br> 

**ASSIGNMENT:** 
> For your discussion topic this week, find one data-driven blog post from Ben Wellington's [I Quant NY](http://iquantny.tumblr.com/) and/or OK Cupid's [OK Trends](https://theblog.okcupid.com/tagged/data) where you discovered something cool that you did not know, and share it with the group. In your post highlight what is interesting about the example, and what data made it possible.

<br>

You can also check out Ben's [Ted Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xsvGYIxJok), or this short interview.

### Aug 31-Sept 7: The Perils of Open Data

Big and open data can generate powerful insights, but with great power comes great responsibility. In some cases, it might create transparency and improve policy. In others it can be used to manipulate populations and distort accountability. 

"[The Data that Turned the World Upside Down:](https://publicpolicy.stanford.edu/news/data-turned-world-upside-down) How Cambridge Analytica used your Facebook data to help the Donald Trump campaign in the 2016 election.", 

This example poses many interesting dilemas. The Obama campaign was celebrated for using data to enhance voter mobilization. One can argue that the Trump campaign simply embraced the same strategy. Are we being unfair to laude one candidate for his data acumen but criticize another for similar tactics? What are the important differences between the two cases? 

**ASSIGNMENT:**  
> For your disccusion this week, post a pin with some thoughts about the potential downside of big & open data, ethics in a time of big data, and what sorts of privacy rules you would devise to balance the benefits that can come from access to data along with challenges of data governance.

### Sept 9 - Sept 16: The Best of R

You might not have heard, but [nerd is the new black](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323478304578332850293360468), data science is the [sexiest job of the 21st century](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century), and there is [nothing hotter](http://www.startfactor.pt/uploads/3/8/5/0/38505347/r-is-still-hot.pdf) than learning R.

But what is R, and what are the ~~nerds~~ cool kids using it for? 

**This week, your task is to explore a few blogs about tools in R and find one package or application that you are excited about. It can be an analytics package, a graphics package, a specific application, or otherwise.**

Mine, personally, was the package that allows you to create comic strip graphics in R:

[xkcd comics](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12675147/how-can-we-make-xkcd-style-graphs)

Be warned up-front, this assignment might be overwhelming in you are wading into a new community where the technical language is unfamiliar and the volume of information vast. There are currently over 13,000 packages available in R! That is partly the point of the assignment - recognizing the sheer volume of creativity surrounding the R community. But also learning how to find some sources that make the content accessible. Here are a few to get you started:

[awesome r](https://awesome-r.com/)

[cran views](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/)

[best of r blogs](https://blog.feedspot.com/r_programming_blogs/)

[r-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/)

### Sept 17 - Sept 23: Data Visualization

To kick-off our data visualization segment of the course, this exercise is designed to introduce you to some cool data visualizaion communities. 

[Makeover Mondays](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a weekly exercise where an organization shares a mediocre visualization and the data used to create it, then volunteers from around the world work to create a more informative or compelling visualization.

For your post this week, please select one graphic from their [Gallery](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/gallery/), post it to YellowDig, and explain what you think makes the graphic compelling? What works? **Specific, how did the creators use graphical or design elements to generate insight from the data, create a story, and leave the viewer with a clear take-away?**

### Sept 24 - Sept 30: Bad Graphs

There is a lot of science behind data visualization, but also an art to storytelling with data that is hard to explain or teach. The best way to gain skill in this area is regularly consume interesting graphics. David McCandless is one of the best ambassadors for the field of graphic design. Check out his TED Talk,  and some excerpts from his book [*Information is Beautiful*]( https://github.com/DS4PS/Data-Science-Class/raw/master/READINGS/mccandless_information_is_beautiful.pdf).

<div style="max-width:560px"><div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%"><iframe src="https://embed.ted.com/talks/david_mccandless_the_beauty_of_data_visualization" width="854" height="480" style="position:absolute;left:0;top:0;width:100%;height:100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>

Unfortunatly, it is much easier to create tragically bad graphics than it is to create good graphics. For your blog this week, read the *Calling Bullshit* overview on [proportional ink](https://callingbullshit.org/tools/tools_proportional_ink.html) and [misleading axes](https://callingbullshit.org/tools/tools_misleading_axes.html) to develop some sensitivity about how to lie with graphics. 

Find a graph that violates one of these principles, or commits an equally egregious visualization crime. Share the graph and explain what offense has been committed. 

This use of [clowns](https://peltiertech.com/bad-bar-chart-practices-or-send-in-the-clowns/) in bar charts is one of my favorites. You might also enjoy [pizza charts](http://getdolphins.com/blog/the-worst-graphs-of-2017/) or [these gems](https://www.distractify.com/humor/2017/05/26/cszBB/hilariously-bad-graphs).

# Course Overview

Welcome to Intro to Data Science for the Social Sector. This is a broad overview course designed to expose you to common and useful open source tools in the field. 

A few notes about the semester:


### Rules for Success

Learning a new skill like R programming is never painless, but you can follow a few simple rules to succeed at this course:

* Find a study group.
* Work until you get stuck, then post a question to the [discussion forum](https://ds4ps.github.io/course_website/discussions/).
* [Schedule office hours](https://calendly.com/lecy/15min) when needed.
* Attend weekly review sessions
 

### Data Science Applications in the Social Sector

It is always helpful to motivate a topic with an example. I like this case study of change that occurred when the Philadelphia police began transitioning from managing a department using instinct of senior officers to using data to identify areas of high need and most effective practices.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZJNESMhIxQ0?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>


### What is Data Science? 

"A data scientist is a person who should be able to leverage existing data sources, and create new ones as needed in order to extract meaningful information and actionable insights. These insights can be used to drive business decisions and changes intended to achieve business goals... ‘The Perfect Data Scientist’ is the individual who is equally strong in business, programming, statistics, and communication."

FROM: [ What Is Data Science, and What Does a Data Scientist Do? ](https://www.innoarchitech.com/what-is-data-science-does-data-scientist-do/)

"Universities can hardly turn out data scientists fast enough. To meet demand from employers, the United States will need to increase the number of graduates with skills handling large amounts of data by as much as 60 percent."

FROM: [Data Science: The Numbers of Our Lives, The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/14/education/edlife/universities-offer-courses-in-a-hot-new-field-data-science.html)

“Data Scientists identify complex business problems whilst leveraging data value. They work as part of a multidisciplinary team with data architects, data engineers, analysts and others.”

FROM: [Data Scientist Career Pathways in Government](https://github.com/ukgovdatascience/data_scientist_career_path/blob/master/index.md).


### Why R?

This course is organized around learning the foundations of programming in R. Although there are several good choices for languages that specialize in data analysis, R has advantages:

* It is completely free and open source.
* It has a large and active user community.
* R Studio has integrated many tools from the 'data science ecosystem' so that lots of tasks can be done with a single language, making the return on time spent learning R much higher.

For some background information on R, read the New York Times story: [Data Analysts Captivated by R’s Power](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/07/technology/business-computing/07program.html). Or Check out this 1-minute explainer video:

<br>

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/180644880" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>

<br>

You will find this background information helpful as you start using R:

* [ Helpful Vocabulary ](https://github.com/DS4PS/Data-Science-Class/raw/master/HANDOUTS/Helpful%20Programming%20Vocabulary.pdf)
* [ Base R Cheat Sheet ](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/base-r.pdf)

See the [Resources](https://ds4ps.github.io/course_website/resources/) tab for some additional information about R and R Studio.




# Grades

Your grade is comprised of the following:
 
* 60% - Weekly labs  
* 20% - Final project 
* 20% - Discussion boards 

Labs will give you practice with the key concepts and functions of the week. They are graded pass-fail and you get to drop one lab (chances are you will have one rough week this semester). To pass you need to get at least half of the questions correct and demonstrate that you understand the material. 

This grading system is designed as a way for you to focus on the big picture each week and not worry if a specific function or model is not working properly. Computer languages can be unforgiving in the sense that one minor error can prevent the program from running. 

Learning a programming language is a lot like learning a natural language in that it is easy to become conversant enough to find your way around a city and order some food at a restaurant, but much harder to become fluent. The goal is for you to become conversant in R by the end of the semester so that you can begin using tutorials and discussion forums to further your journey.

Discussion boards will be used to reflect upon case studies of data science tools in practice. The final project will require you to practice skills from the semester by building a basic dashboard.
