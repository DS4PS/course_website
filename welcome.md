# Welcome to the Course!

Welcome to Intro to Data Science for the Social Sector. This is a broad overview course designed to expose you to common and useful open source tools in the field. 

A few notes about the course and the semester:

#### Textbook

You are not required to purchase a textbook. I have referenced several useful reference texts in the syllabus, many of which are available free online.

The text available on this website is a set of lecture notes created using Markdown documents so that you can easily copy and paste code from the examples, or borrow document formats that you like. All of the raw files are available on GitHub, and can be easily accessed by clicking on the "edit" link on each page. 

#### Assignments

Your grade is comprised of the following:

* 10% - Discussion boards  
* 60% - Weekly labs  
* 30% - Final project   

Labs will give you practice with the key concepts and functions of the week. They are graded pass-fail and you get to drop one lab (chances are you will have one rough week this semester). To pass you need to get at least half of the questions correct and demonstrate that you understand the material. 

This grading system is designed as a way for you to focus on the big picture each week and not worry if a specific function or model is not working properly. Computer languages can be unforgiving in the sense that one minor error can prevent the program from running. 

Learning a programming language is a lot like learning a natural language in that it is easy to become conversant enough to find your way around a city and order some food at a restaurant, but much harder to become fluent. The goal is for you to become conversant in R by the end of the semester so that you can begin using tutorials and discussion forums to further your journey.

Discussion boards will be used to reflect upon case studies of data science tools in practice. The final project will require you to practice skills from the semester by building a basic dashboard.


#### In-Person Review Sessions

The course can be completed by following lectures and labs online, but I will also offer a weekly face-to-face review sessions if you prefer to ask questions or discuss content in a classroom. We will do our best to find times that can accomodates everyone. 

Make sure to complete the [Doodle Poll](https://doodle.com/poll/2v4yszxnmihcpxqw) to report your availability if you would like to attend. 

#### Rules for Success

Learning a new skill like R programming is never painless, but you can follow a few simple rules to succeed at this course:

* Find a study group
* Work until you get stuck, then post a question to the discussion forum
* Schedule office hours when needed
* Attend weekly review sessions
 

# Introduction to Data Science 

## Data Science Applications in Governments and Nonprofits?

It is always helpful to motivate a topic with an example. I like this case study of change that occurred when the Philadelphia police began transitioning from managing a department using instinct of senior officers to using data to identify areas of high need and most effective practices.

## What is Data Science? 

> A data scientist is a person who should be able to leverage existing data sources, and create new ones as needed in order to extract meaningful information and actionable insights. These insights can be used to drive business decisions and changes intended to achieve business goals... ‘The Perfect Data Scientist’ is the individual who is equally strong in business, programming, statistics, and communication.

FROM: [ What Is Data Science, and What Does a Data Scientist Do? ](https://www.innoarchitech.com/what-is-data-science-does-data-scientist-do/)

> Universities can hardly turn out data scientists fast enough. To meet demand from employers, the United States will need to increase the number of graduates with skills handling large amounts of data by as much as 60 percent.

FROM: [Data Science: The Numbers of Our Lives, The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/14/education/edlife/universities-offer-courses-in-a-hot-new-field-data-science.html)

> “Data Scientists identify complex business problems whilst leveraging data value. They work as part of a multidisciplinary team with data architects, data engineers, analysts and others.”
